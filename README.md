# This is my first experimentation with Scrollmagic

Scrollorama is a deprecated library using jQuery. After some searching I've found the most current update of this type of library it is called scrollscene. [Here](https://github.com/jonkwheeler/ScrollScene) is the link to that library.

To make this project funtion I'm using webpack to import both scrollscene and gsap from my node modules. Gsap stands for GreenSock Animation Platform. I believe this is used for the animations built into Scrollscene. More experimentation will tell about that.
